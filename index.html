		<h1><strong>Seeing Networks in Wellington City - A Guide to Looking Out</strong></h1>
		<p>Wellington City, the capital of New Zealand, isn’t named the coolest little city in the world for no reason. A compact city, it encompasses a waterfront promenade, sandy beaches, a working harbour and colourful timber houses on surrounding hills. Strong winds through the Cook Strait give it the nickname "Windy Wellington." However, aside from all the things Wellington city is known for - theres an increasingly high development in the networking aspect of the city. Although it may be a little difficult to search for signs of any evident network infrastructure, heres a little guide to how to search for these very things that make the city run.</a></p>

			<h1>Signs</h1>
			<p>You will find the city is constantly under construction especially after the November 2016 earthquake which shook the city to its core. This meant a lot of buildings were found to need earthquake strengthening. However, aside from the earthquakes, the city is a huge commercial fest and this means constant monitoring. Below you will see an example of how commercial properties monitor activities.</p>

				<h3>At KFC</h3>
				<p>Often you will see signs around Wellington city indicating that a certain area has CCTV cameras recording footage. This is what the sign typically looks like and is usually plastered on commercial properties and businesses to let people know that they are being recorded</p>

			<h1>Antennas</h1>
			<p>So we have plenty of ground traffic lights which are put in place to ensure traffic control. However, what about other forms of traffic? Here’s an example of different types of network designed to control air traffic.</p>

				<h3>Air Traffic Control</h3>
				<p>The air traffic control building sits very close to the Wellington airport (if not right next to it). Air traffic controllers often abbreviated ATC are personnel responsible for the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic in the global air traffic control system. Usually stationed in air traffic control centers and control towers on the ground, they monitor the position, speed, and altitude of aircraft in their assigned airspace visually and by radar, and give directions to the pilots by radio. This network sight provides and plays an important role in air traffic control.</p>

			<h1>Utility Poles</h1>
			<p>These are a bit old fashioned however they are critical components of high-speed fiber optic internet access.</p>

				<h3>Future Internet Access</h3>
				<p>These are basically seen everywhere around the city and for the most part just provide tv network however, it is said in the future, a lot of the high-speed finer optic internet access will reply on these poles even if it means reprogramming each and every pole to provide the net we need.</p>

			<h1>Cameras</h1>
			<p>Many (if not all) traffic lights will have cameras attached to the them to record activity of the traffic</p>

				<h3>Traffic Cameras</h3>
				<p>This one here is the most common type of traffic camera that is attached to almost every traffic light at every traffic light intersection. These are important and used mainly for recording footage of traffic as well as providing proof for accidents and law breakers who run the red traffic signals etc.</p>

				<h3>CCTV Cameras</h3>
				<p>This one here is the most common type of traffic camera that is attached to almost every traffic light at every traffic light intersection. These are important and used mainly for recording footage of traffic as well as providing proof for accidents and law breakers who run the red traffic signals etc. The shape of the camera makes it difficult for onlookers to tell which way the camera is facing, which is a strong piece of design, deterring criminals by creating an air of uncertainty. These cameras are constantly sending information to NZTA who are able to then track the activities of traffic behaviour.</p>

				<h3>Day/Night Cameras</h3>
				<p>Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips. For this reason, these cameras are ideal for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are unable to function optimally. These cameras are typically placed around more sneaky areas of the city to catch  drivers off guard and provide great security camera footage due its low light recording capability. Information is recorded and also sent to NZTA</p>

				<h3>Security Cameras</h3>
				<p>Just another example of security camera being in place. This one here is just outside the Weta Digital office parkings in Miramar.</p>

			<h1>Sightseeing</h1>
			<p>Although this one example may not be your typical network object, the very famous Brooklyn Wind Turbine surely makes a cut. The original Brooklyn wind turbine, on the hills above Wellington, was the oldest operating wind turbine in New Zealand. It began generating in 1993 and operated reliably for 17 years before any major repairs were required. However, in April 2016 Meridian upgraded the Brooklyn turbine with a larger turbine that generates enough renewable energy to power around 490 average homes a year.</p>

				<h3>The Brooklyn Wind Turbine</h3>
				<p>The Brooklyn Wind Turbine is a spectacular sight which many tourists make it a point to visit. This massive turbine plays an important role in providing electricity around Wellington - which also means network interference and interaction. And although this one may not be directly related to the Internet side of things, it does play somewhat of a role in the networking world of things.</p>
